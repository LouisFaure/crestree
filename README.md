# crestree
A set of methods developed to model cell fate decision landscape of early mouse neural crest.

A walkthrough guide for modelling transcriptional tree is described in https://github.com/hms-dbmi/crestree/blob/master/vignettes/tree_guide.md

Analysis of bifurcation point, using sensory-autonomic bifurcation as example, is described in https://github.com/hms-dbmi/crestree/blob/master/vignettes/bifurcation_point.md
